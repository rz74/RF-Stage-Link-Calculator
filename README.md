# RF-Stage-Link-Calculator
This calculator imports data for each stage in a RF system and calculates the cascaded gain, power, NF, P1dB, and Psat at any point in the system. Each stage is modeled as an object with s2p, power and noise profiles and can be any RF stages including PA/LNAs, equalizers, attunators, and has a built-in modeler for passive losses like wire bonds. 
The calculator expects: s-parameters as s2p files, which is usually provided by the vender or taken by the user on a VNA; power and noise profiles as csv files. These files are cleaned and interploated within the calculator for the frequency range and step size input by the user.
