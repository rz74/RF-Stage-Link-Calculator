# RF-Stage-Link-Calculator
This calculator imports data for each stage in a RF system and calculates the cascaded gain, power, NF, P1dB, and Psat at any point in the system. Each stage is modeled as an object with s2p, power and noise profiles and can be any RF stages including PA/LNAs, equalizers, attunators, and has a built-in modeler for passive losses like wire bonds.
